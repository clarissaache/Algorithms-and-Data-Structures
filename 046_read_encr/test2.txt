In the last problem, you saw an implementation of a simple
"encryption" program.  In this problem, you will write a program
that breaks that encryption---that is, it will take as input
a text file encrypted with the program from 046_read_encr and print out
the key used to encrypt it!

Breaking the Caesar Cipher uses a technique called "frequency counting."
This technique relies on the fact that the distribution of letters
in the English alphabet is far from uniform: 'e' is by far the most
common letter (~13%), followed by 't' (9%), and 'a' (8%).  Note
that the average frequency is 100/26 ~= 4%. 

This frequency distribution means that if you know (or suspect)
that a file contains English text encrypted with a Caesar Cipher,
you can simply count the frequency of all letters in it and guess
that the letter which occurs most often is 'e'.  Once you know
which letter is 'e', you can backsolve for the key and decrypt
the file.  Note that in practice this requires a large enough
text that "the law of large numbers" applies---and while it is
not guaranteed to work, it typically does.
