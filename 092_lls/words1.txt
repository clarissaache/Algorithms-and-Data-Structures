Hopefully your test code is generic (did you do anything with ints
specifically?) To test with other types, we have provided you with a
"count.cpp" file, which uses the LinkedList that you wrote in a
variety of ways. This program takes two command line arguments (both
of which name files), reads in those files--splitting them into
"words" (note that it does a very simple job of this), counts how many
occurences of each word there are in the first file, removes all the
words that appear in the second file, sorts the remaining list, and
prints the results.
